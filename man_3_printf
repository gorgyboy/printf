.B _printf 
- formatted output conversion

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B_printf()
produces output according to a format as described.

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR %c
The  int argument is converted to an unsigned char
.TP
.B %s
The char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to a terminating NULL character, ('\0'), but it is not including; if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified are written.  If a precision is given, no null byte  need  be  present;  if the precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating null byte.
.TP
.B %%
A  `%'  is  written.  No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is `%%'.
.TP
.B %i
i The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B %d
d The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B %b
d The int argument is converted to binary notation.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters printed (not including the trailing `\\0' used to end output to strings).
.SH EXAMPLES
